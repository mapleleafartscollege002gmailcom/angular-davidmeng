    <p>It&#39;s a good idea to begin your survey with an introduction. Write an introduction with the assumption that respondents don&#39;t know much, if anything, about the topic of your survey.</p>

    <p>Use simple, clear language to briefly explain the topic and purpose of the survey. Your introduction only needs to be three or four sentences, or a couple of short paragraphs at most.</p>

    <p>Include the following useful information in your introduction:</p>

    <ul><li>Your name or the name of the company or organization you represent</li><li>The goal of the survey or what you&#39;re trying to find out</li><li>How you&#39;ll be using the responses to make a difference</li><li>If the responses are <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-do-I-make-surveys-anonymous" target="_self">anonymous, confidential, or tracked</a></li><li>Relevant instructions that aren&#39;t explained in the survey questions themselves</li><li>Any <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-do-I-create-a-consent-form-or-disqualify-respondents-from-a-survey" target="_self">consent statement or privacy policy</a> required by your company or organization</li></ul>

    <p>It&#39;s likely that some of your survey questions won&#39;t apply to all respondents taking your survey. You can <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-is-Skip-Logic" target="_self">use Skip Logic</a> to guide respondents directly to relevant questions and have them skip over questions that don&#39;t apply to them, providing a better surveying experience for respondents and increasing the success of your survey project.</p>
